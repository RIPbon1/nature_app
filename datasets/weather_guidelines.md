# Weather Safety and Guidelines

## Air Quality Index (AQI) Guidelines
AQI is a standardized system for measuring air quality. Values 0-50 are considered good, 51-100 moderate, 101-150 unhealthy for sensitive groups, 151-200 unhealthy, 201-300 very unhealthy, and 301+ hazardous. During poor air quality days, limit outdoor activities and use air purifiers indoors.

## Storm Safety Guidelines
During thunderstorms, seek shelter indoors immediately. Avoid open areas, tall objects, and water. If caught outside, crouch low with feet together and minimize contact with the ground. Stay away from windows and electrical equipment during lightning storms.

## Heat Safety
During extreme heat, stay hydrated, wear lightweight clothing, and avoid strenuous outdoor activities during peak hours (10 AM - 4 PM). Check on elderly neighbors and never leave children or pets in parked vehicles.

## Cold Weather Safety
Dress in layers during cold weather. Cover extremities (hands, feet, head) to prevent frostbite. Be aware of wind chill factors and limit time outdoors during extreme cold.

## Flood Safety
Never drive through flooded areas. Turn around, don't drown. Move to higher ground if flooding occurs. Avoid walking or swimming in floodwaters as they may contain dangerous debris or contaminants.
